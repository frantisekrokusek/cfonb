# CFONB Parser

This parser aim at simplifying the parsing of CFONB structured files.
Which are files structured with either 120 or 240 characters lines containing mostly bank statements.
We aimed here only at the 120 characters version.

What CFONB means ? `ComitÃ© FranÃ§ais dâ€™Organisation et de Normalisation Bancaire`
